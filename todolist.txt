- [x] check degrees RT(0), RT(1), .., RT(5) and convergence rates
- [x] check 3d (new reference solution, ethier/steinmann?)
- [x] distort_random() 2d and 3d?
- [x] check if adaptivity works
- [ ] L shape singular solution
- [ ] linear solvers? AMG? GMG?
- [ ] switch to BDM, implement project_boundary_values_div_conforming(),
then check all the things above
- [ ] non-orientable 3d geometry (GridGenerator::moebius with 180 degrees)
- [ ] problem on curved geometry (test problem from Timo,
http://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/manual.pdf section 5.4.8/9)
- [ ] add pressure non-robustness constant
- [ ] mesh loop conversion
- [ ] write the tutorial
- [ ] documentation improvements inside deal.II (RT / BDM)

tutorial:
- what spaces? DG vs RT|BDM?
- show pressure-robustness of hdiv method
- need strong u*n for hdiv to get div u=0
- what is "new"? hdiv with stokes, new fancy DG assembly
- use mesh_loop? yes
- test problem: hollow sphere?

- adaptivity? no
- parallel? solvers? no
