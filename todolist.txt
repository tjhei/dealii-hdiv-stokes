- check degrees RT(0), RT(1), .., RT(5) and convergence rates
- check 3d (new reference solution, ethier/steinmann?)
- distort_random() 2d and 3d?
- check if adaptivity works
- linear solvers? AMG? GMG?
- switch to BDM, implement project_boundary_values_div_conforming(),
then check all the things above
- problem on curved geometry (test problem from Timo,
http://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/manual.pdf section 5.4.8/9)


tutorial:
- what spaces? DG vs RT|BDM?
- show pressure-robustness of hdiv method
- what is "new"? hdiv with stokes, new fancy DG assembly
- use mesh_loop? yes
- test problem: hollow sphere?

- adaptivity? no
- parallel? solvers? no
